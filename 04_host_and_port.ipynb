    "# Host\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition:\n",
    "A host is any computer or device connected to a network that provides or requests services. It can be a physical machine (like your laptop or server) or a virtual machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Addressing:\n",
    "Each host on a network is identified by an IP address (Internet Protocol address), which is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- IPv4: 192.168.1.1\n",
    "\n",
    "- IPv6: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334\n",
    "\n",
    "### Domain Name:\n",
    "Instead of IP addresses, hosts often use domain names for easier human use. For example, www.google.com is a domain name that resolves to an IP address.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Role:\n",
    "The host can act as a server (providing services, e.g., web server) or a client (requesting services)."

    "# Port\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition:\n",
    "A port is a logical endpoint or communication channel on a host that identifies a specific process or service running on that device.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numbering:\n",
    "Ports are identified by a 16-bit number ranging from 0 to 65535.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Well-known ports (0-1023)**: Reserved for common services, e.g.,\n",
    "\n",
    "    - HTTP: port 80\n",
    "\n",
    "    - HTTPS: port 443\n",
    "\n",
    "    - FTP: port 21\n",
    "\n",
    "    - SSH: port 22\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Registered ports (1024-49151)**: Assigned to user processes or applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic/private ports (49152-65535)**: Used for temporary or private connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose:\n",
    "Ports allow multiple network services to run on a single host. For example, a web server might listen on port 80 for HTTP requests, while an email server listens on port 25."

    "# How Host and Port Work Together\n",
    "\n",
    "When a device wants to communicate with a service on another device, it specifies:\n",
    "\n",
    "The host (IP address or domain) — to know which machine to talk to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The port — to know which service or application on that machine to communicate with.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "If you open a browser and go to http://example.com:8080, the host is example.com (which resolves to an IP address), and the port is 8080, telling your computer to connect to the web service running on port 8080 on the host."

    "# IP Assignment and Network Interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. IP is assigned to a Network Interface Card (NIC)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **IP is assigned to a Network Interface Card (NIC).**  \n",
    "- A machine can have **multiple NICs** (e.g., Wi-Fi, Ethernet, virtual adapters).  \n",
    "- Each NIC can have **its own IP address**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example on a Mac:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Interface | Type       | IP Address     |\n",
    "|------------|-------------|----------------|\n",
    "| `en0`      | Wi-Fi       | `192.168.1.10` |\n",

    "| `lo0`      | Loopback    | `127.0.0.1`    |\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Conclusion:**  \n",
    "The **IP address** is bound to a **specific network interface**, not to the **machine as a whole**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. The machine can have multiple IPs\n",
    "\n",
    "- If your Mac has multiple NICs active at the same time, it effectively has multiple IP addresses.\n",
    "- Some software sees the “primary” IP (typically the one used for outbound traffic), but each NIC can communicate independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Public vs Local IP\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Local IP (LAN)**: Assigned to your NIC by the router (DHCP). Visible only inside your network.\n",
    "- **Public IP (WAN)**: Assigned to your network by your ISP. The router/NAT maps internal NIC IPs to this public IP for internet access.\n"
